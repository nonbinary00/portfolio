# One-Page UX/UI Personal Website

## Customize content
Edit these files:
- `index.html`: your name, bio, case studies, contact links
- `styles.css`: colors, spacing, typography

## Run locally
Because this is a static site, you can open `index.html` directly or use a local server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Push this folder to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, click **Add New Project** and import your repo.
3. Framework preset: **Other**.
4. Build command: leave empty.
5. Output directory: `.` (root).
6. Deploy.

`vercel.json` is included to work with static routing defaults.
